## Overview

A Flask based Web Application that Predicts the Flight Price using RandomForestRegressor.Its GUI is based on Swagger API. This is hosted on the Heroku platform.

## Motivation

People who are travelling in the flights face the problem of price fluctuation to avoid this I thought of to predict the price of the flight ticket so that passenger will have a idea of how much price of flight will be.

## Technical Aspect

1. Firstly I collected dataset from kaggle.I am providing the link of the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RFnObzTjFsrGVOzpw6q_WYQQJoehglA2?usp=sharing).

2. Now I used did exploratory data analysis by cleaning the dataset.

3. Now I did the feature engineering and identified which features affect our prices .

4. Then I build a model using random forest regression and tuned hyper parameters to improve the performance.

5. I used the Swagger API to create a GUI for web application and used flask to deal with the requests and predict the outputs and run the application in the development server .
6. Now I add the requirements and ProcFile and deployed using Heroku CLI.
